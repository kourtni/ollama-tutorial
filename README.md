# Ollama Tutorial
This is my first attempt at working with LLMs to create Intelligent Digital Workers.

Eventually this project will implement the ideas discussed [here](https://quickaitutorial.com/crewai-solor-hermes-langchain-ollama-super-ai-agent/)

For now, this simple example just connects to a running Ollama server and streams it's response
to a hard-coded question.

## Running the Ollama server
```
> ollama serve
```

## Running the example code
```
> python main.py
```
